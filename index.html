            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jamie Sessions.</p>
            <p>I am a dual-major in International Studies and Political Science at the University of Idaho, focusing on the intersection of international relations, sociology, and political ideologies.</p>
            <p>My goal is to understand how the world works—both through human systems and digital ones. Beyond my academic studies, I am deeply interested in intelligence analysis, languages, and penetration testing, using my technical background in Python and hardware to explore the vulnerabilities in modern systems.</p>
            <p>I currently serve as a Cadet in the Army ROTC Chrisman Battalion and a member of the Idaho Army National Guard. This blog serves as a documentation of my work, ranging from political analysis to cybersecurity projects.</p>
